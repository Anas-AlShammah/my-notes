### Termial command line
<font color="FFA533" />
Once upon a time, in a land of computers and operating systems, there was a magical tool called the Terminal Command Line. This tool allowed the people of the land to interact with their computers in a powerful and direct way.

To use this tool, the people would open a window on their computer called a terminal, and start typing commands into it. These commands would tell the computer what to do, and the computer would respond by carrying out the task.
